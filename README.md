Dev Jobs Scrapper

This is a pretty simple project in Python and MongoDB, created by [@rlegan](https://github.com/rlegan) and me.
We scrap the lastest job offers on the french biggest startup campus Station F, on one of the biggest job site Welcome To The Jungle, and finally another big french job site Jobteaser, and send them on a Discord channel, in order to be notified as soon as possible.
The requirements.txt and Procfile are necessary because the bot is hosted on Heroku.
