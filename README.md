Dev Jobs Scrapper

This is a pretty simple project in Python and MongoDB, created by @rlegan and me.
We scrap the lastest job offers on the french biggest startup campus @Station F, and on one of the biggest job site Welcome To The Jungle and send them on a Discord channel, in order to be notified as soon as possible.
The requirements.txt and Procfile are necessary because the bot is hosted on Heroku.
